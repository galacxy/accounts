This app named 'bank' is based on Django Framework. 

About

We (me and my friends) often go for outings and involv money matters. It so happened that many a times the answer to 
'who paid how much money' was lost after a day. So I decided to make an app that can cater to this diktat.

I decided python language as my language although I had a very little idea about it but I thought I will also be a 
great learning venture. Then I found about Django Framework to develop upon.I selected mysql to be my database, as I had 
little prior experience with it.

And from there I had to explore many things to get a particular task done, Stackoverflow.com is a heaven for me,answer
to almost every query could be found on it. 

The process is still going on as I have to implement security(not so high, only as necessary) in it.
